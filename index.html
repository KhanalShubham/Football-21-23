                Our Era Impact Score normalizes output across leagues using UEFA coefficients and market value data.
                Striker goals are weighted differently from midfielder chances created. Discipline and defensive work
                rate are factored into the final calculation.

                    <h3>Key Metrics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Key Pass</strong>: A pass that directly creates a shot or a clear scoring chance per 90 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery</strong>: Successful regains of possession (tackles, interceptions, loose balls) per 90 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Negative events such as fouls, bookings, and errors leading to shots or goals.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h3>Why De Bruyne?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kevin De Bruyne ranks #1 because this model places a high weight on creative volume
                        (Key Passes + Assists) rather than pure goal scoring. His elite chance creation stacked
                        across multiple seasons generates more cumulative Impact Points than even the best pure finishers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, repeated high-value creation for teammates is treated as just as valuable as
                        scoring the goals yourself in this specific weighted framework.

                    <h3>Model Perspective</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Era Impact Engine v3 leans into <strong>repeatable process</strong> over single-season peaks.
                        Players who consistently drive shot volume, territory, and possession over multiple years
                        accumulate more points than one‑season outliers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creative hubs like De Bruyne benefit because every key pass and assisted shot is rewarded.
                        Pure scorers only close the gap if their goals arrive at extreme volume while still contributing
                        in link play and defensive work.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Honorable Mentions (Outside Top 8)</h3>
                    <ul class="honorable-list">
                        <li><strong>Rodri</strong> (Man City) – Era-defining control midfielder; elite in recoveries and tempo, slightly under-rewarded by a model that caps pure holding value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> (Man Utd / Juventus) – Huge goal volume, but later‑era pressing and creation profile scores lower in this all‑phase model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Karim Benzema</strong> (Real Madrid) – Peak UCL runs rank extremely high, but the window is slightly narrower than the 2020‑2023 era definition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mohamed Salah</strong> (Liverpool) – Monster scorer and chance creator; narrowly misses the very top tier once defensive and league‑adjusted weights are applied.</li>
