## Era Impact Engine v3 – Advanced Era Impact Dashboard

Static web app that ranks and compares top footballers from the 2020–2023 era using a custom Era Impact Score.

### Tech
- Pure static frontend: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
- Chart rendering via Chart.js CDN

### Run locally
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static server (e.g. VS Code Live Server, `python -m http.server`, etc.)

### Deploying to GitHub Pages (quick outline)
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub (e.g. `era-impact-engine`).
2. Push this folder as the `main` branch.
3. In the repo Settings → Pages, set Source to `Deploy from a branch` → `main` → `/ (root)`.
4. GitHub will give you a live URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/era-impact-engine/`.
